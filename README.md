In machine learning, computers apply statistical learning techniques to automatically identify patterns in data. These techniques can be used to make highly accurate predictions. Finding patterns in data is where machine learning comes in. Machine learning methods use statistical learning to identify boundaries. 

One example of a machine learning method is a decision tree. Decision trees look at one variable at a time and are a reasonably accessible (though rudimentary) machine learning method.

```
A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, 
if its performance on t, as measured by P, improves with experience E

# Deep Learning

In early editions of this guide, there was no specific "Deep Learning" section. I omitted it intentionally. I think it is not effective for us to jump too far ahead. I also know that if you become an expert in traditional Machine Learning, you'll be capable of moving onto advanced subjects like Deep Learning, whether or not I've put that in this guide. We're just trying to get you started here!

Maybe this is a way to check your progress: ask yourself, does Deep Learning seem like magic? If so, take that as a sign that you aren't ready to work with it professionally. Let the fascination motivate you to learn more. I have read some argue you can learn Deep Learning in isolation; I have read others recommend it's best to master traditional Machine Learning first. Why not start with traditional Machine Learning, and develop your reasoning and intuition there? You'll only have an easier time learning Deep Learning after that. After all of it, you'll able to tackle all sorts of interesting problems.

## Have Fun
So you are dabbling with Machine Learning. You've got Hacking Skills. Maybe you've got some "knowledge" in Domingos' sense (some "Substantive Expertise" or "Domain Knowledge"). This diagram is modified slightly from Drew Conway's "Data Science Venn Diagram." It isn't a perfect fit for us, but it may get the point across:

<b>Please</b> don't sell yourself as a Machine Learning expert while you're still in the Danger Zone. Don't build bad products or publish junk science. (Also please don't be evil.) This guide can't tell you how you'll know you've "made it" into Machine Learning competence ... let alone expertise. It's hard to evaluate proficiency without schools or other institutions. This is a common problem for self-taught people.
